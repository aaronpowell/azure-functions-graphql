# Azure Functions GraphQL Sample

This repository contains a sample of how to run a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) server on [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/functions/?WT.mc_id=javascript-7132-aapowell) using [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com)'s integration.

You can read more on how to build this [on my blog](https://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2020-08-07-graphql-on-azure-part-3-serverless-with-javascript/).
